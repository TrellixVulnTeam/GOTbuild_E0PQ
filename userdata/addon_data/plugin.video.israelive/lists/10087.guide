What makes a survivor when all around drop like flies? 2.8 million years ago, triggered by slight changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun and shifts in its ocean currents, the world began to cool. Within a few thousand years much of the planet was shrouded in a dense cloak of ice that would come and go until only 10,000 years ago.

He shows how electronic music crossed over from pop into cinema with Midnight Express and Chariots of Fire, while films like Apocalypse Now pioneered the concept of sound design.

Whether the tragic hero or the young romantic lead, whether dramatic or lyric, the tenor usually gets the girl, even if they rarely live happily ever after. Antonio examines the techniques behind the bravura performances, featuring great tenors such as Enrico Caruso, Luciano Pavarotti, Franco Corelli, Fritz Wunderlich, Jon Vickers, Peter Pears and Mario Lanza. With contributions from leading tenors of today and a voice lesson from Thomas Allen, Antonio seeks out the tricks of the trade. How does a tenor 'colour' his voice? Why do his high notes provoke an animal response in audiences? How does he sing from bottom to top of his two-octave range without seeming to change gear? And why did the tenor only come centre stage in the 1830s?"}, {"start": 1458507600, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/290582/e98e95a8c885d699e22206cd08c0698e.jpg", "end": 1458513000, "name": "Darcey Bussell Dances Hollywood", "description": "Darcey Bussell steps into the shoes of her Hollywood heroes to celebrate the enduring legacy of classic dance musicals.

This extraordinary commitment was rewarded, and within a few years, the whole of Lakeland was under Roman control.
