Paris, 1941. A family of scientists is on the brink of discovering a powerful longevity serum when all of a sudden a mysterious force abducts them, leaving their young daughter April behind. Ten years later, April (Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard) lives alone with her cat, Darwin, and carries on her family's research in secret. But she soon finds herself at the center of a shadowy and far- reaching conspiracy, and on the run from government agents, bicycle-powered dirigibles and cyborg rat spies.", "mpaa_rating": "PG", "year": 2016, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "3422078"}, "posters": {"profile": "http://resizing.flixster.com/QriZsdwxrGP1MXj04Yx4rxVDUUo=/54x79/v1.bTsxMTY5MDA3NDtqOzE2OTM5OzIwNDg7ODEzMDsxMTg4MA", "detailed": "http://resizing.flixster.com/QriZsdwxrGP1MXj04Yx4rxVDUUo=/54x79/v1.bTsxMTY5MDA3NDtqOzE2OTM5OzIwNDg7ODEzMDsxMTg4MA", "thumbnail": "http://resizing.flixster.com/QriZsdwxrGP1MXj04Yx4rxVDUUo=/54x79/v1.bTsxMTY5MDA3NDtqOzE2OTM5OzIwNDg7ODEzMDsxMTg4MA", "original": "http://resizing.flixster.com/QriZsdwxrGP1MXj04Yx4rxVDUUo=/54x79/v1.bTsxMTY5MDA3NDtqOzE2OTM5OzIwNDg7ODEzMDsxMTg4MA"}, "runtime": 106, "id": "771418961"}, {"ratings": {"critics_score": -1, "audience_score": 93}, "links": {"reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771437561/reviews.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771437561/cast.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771437561.json", "alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/theyre_watching/", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771437561/similar.json"}, "title": "They're Watching", "release_dates": {"dvd": "2016-03-25", "theater": "2016-03-25"}, "abridged_cast": [{"name": "Brigid Brannagh", "characters": ["Becky Westlake"], "id": "497057899"}, {"name": "Carrie Genzel", "characters": ["Kate Banks"], "id": "770767252"}, {"name": "David Alpay", "characters": ["Greg Abernathy"], "id": "546952134"}, {"name": "Kris Lemche", "characters": ["Alex Torini"], "id": "166849917"}, {"name": "Dimitri Diatchenko", "characters": ["Vladimir Filat"], "id": "770790568"}], "synopsis": "When an American home improvement TV show visits a remote Eastern European village, the young crew thinks the lack of mocha lattes and free wifi will be the worst of their problems.

The feature from writer/director Jonathan Hock and producer Thomas Tull will also be released in theaters and on demand March 25. It is already available for pre-order on iTunes. The essence of baseball is the primal battle between the pitcher and batter, but the magic of the game arises from that confrontation, only 396 milliseconds in the making. The mysteries and memories of Baseball's greatest heroes are revealed in \"Fastball,\" featuring interviews with dozens of former players, from legendary Hall of Famers to current All-Stars. Based on the original idea by the film's producer, Thomas Tull, who also produced the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42,\" \"Fastball\" is peppered with archival footage of baseball's greatest moments plus original high-speed 4K footage and motion graphics that unlock the secrets hidden within a ball traveling over 100 mph. While players, historians, and scientists might disagree on who was actually the fastest pitcher in history - and yes, the film does the physics and concludes with a clear verdict - \"Fastball\" tells the story of the game itself. Jonathan Hock's history with sports runs deep. He is a nine-time Emmy (R) Award winning producer, director, writer and editor. His first documentary feature \"Through the Fire\" had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2005, and his later films \"The Lost Son of Havana\" (2009), \"Off the Rez\" (2011) as well as \"Fastball\" also premiered there. Hock has directed four documentaries for ESPN's Emmy and Peabody Award winning \"30 For 30\" series, including \"Unguarded,\" which was named Best Documentary of the year by Sports Illustrated; \"The Best That Never Was\" (2010); \"Survive and Advance\" (2013) and \"Of Miracles and Men\" (2015).
