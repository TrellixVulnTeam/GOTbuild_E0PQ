The world needs heroes and Lance Armstrong was the ultimate sporting hero. Following a gruelling battle with cancer, Lance returned to his cycling career in 1999 more determined than ever and with his sights set firmly on winning the Tour de France. With the help of the infamous Italian physician Michele Ferrari and team director Johan Bruyneel, he developed the most sophisticated doping program in the history of the sport. This program allowed Lance and his American teammates to dominate the world of cycling, winning the Tour an unprecedented seven times. However not everyone believed the fairytale...Sunday Times journalist, David Walsh, at first charmed by Lance's charisma and talent, soon began to question whether the 'world's greatest athlete' was 'clean'. Walsh sought to unveil the truth, his ensuing battle with Armstrong risked his own career, ostracised him from the cycling community and cost his paper, The Sunday Times, hundreds of thousands in legal costs. But the indefatigable Walsh eventually uncovered the truth when a select few prepared to talk came forward, exposing one of the greatest deceptions of our time. Inspired by the award winning book 'Seven Deadly Sins' by David Walsh, and featuring a stellar cast including Ben Foster (Lone Survivor), Chris O'Dowd (Calvary), Guillaume Canet (Tell No One) and Jesse Plemons (Breaking Bad), THE PROGRAM is a tense and suspenseful thriller.", "mpaa_rating": "R", "year": 2016, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "3083008"}, "posters": {"profile": "http://resizing.flixster.com/4d_64SNlPotewEBNNdPIJ7WuaKs=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTU0OTQ4NztqOzE3MDIwOzIwNDg7NTY3Ozg0MA", "detailed": "http://resizing.flixster.com/4d_64SNlPotewEBNNdPIJ7WuaKs=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTU0OTQ4NztqOzE3MDIwOzIwNDg7NTY3Ozg0MA", "thumbnail": "http://resizing.flixster.com/4d_64SNlPotewEBNNdPIJ7WuaKs=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTU0OTQ4NztqOzE3MDIwOzIwNDg7NTY3Ozg0MA", "original": "http://resizing.flixster.com/4d_64SNlPotewEBNNdPIJ7WuaKs=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTU0OTQ4NztqOzE3MDIwOzIwNDg7NTY3Ozg0MA"}, "runtime": 103, "id": "771420391"}, {"ratings": {"critics_score": 88, "audience_score": 88, "critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "audience_rating": "Upright"}, "links": {"reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771377488/reviews.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771377488/cast.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771377488.json", "alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_short/", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771377488/similar.json"}, "title": "The Big Short", "critics_consensus": "", "release_dates": {"dvd": "2016-03-15", "theater": "2015-12-23"}, "abridged_cast": [{"name": "Christian Bale", "characters": ["Michael Burry"], "id": "162652645"}, {"name": "Steve Carell", "characters": ["Mark Baum"], "id": "162652665"}, {"name": "Ryan Gosling", "characters": ["Jared Vennett"], "id": "162654751"}, {"name": "Brad Pitt", "characters": ["Ben Rickert"], "id": "162652627"}, {"name": "Karen Gillan", "characters": ["Evie"], "id": "770875036"}], "synopsis": "Writer/director Adam McKay joins forces with Paramount Pictures and Plan B Entertainment to adapt Michael Lewis' best-seller The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, which centers on the housing a credit bubble of the 2000s. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "mpaa_rating": "R", "year": 2015, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "3622082"}, "posters": {"profile": "http://resizing.flixster.com/c3-KEGi4gTVl9M7tPD_j6FacjZU=/52x81/v1.bTsxMTIwNzA2ODtqOzE3MDQ3OzIwNDg7ODAwOzEyNDg", "detailed": "http://resizing.flixster.com/c3-KEGi4gTVl9M7tPD_j6FacjZU=/52x81/v1.bTsxMTIwNzA2ODtqOzE3MDQ3OzIwNDg7ODAwOzEyNDg", "thumbnail": "http://resizing.flixster.com/c3-KEGi4gTVl9M7tPD_j6FacjZU=/52x81/v1.bTsxMTIwNzA2ODtqOzE3MDQ3OzIwNDg7ODAwOzEyNDg", "original": "http://resizing.flixster.com/c3-KEGi4gTVl9M7tPD_j6FacjZU=/52x81/v1.bTsxMTIwNzA2ODtqOzE3MDQ3OzIwNDg7ODAwOzEyNDg"}, "runtime": 130, "id": "771377488"}, {"ratings": {"critics_score": 97, "audience_score": 89, "critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "audience_rating": "Upright"}, "links": {"reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771370504/reviews.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771370504/cast.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771370504.json", "alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brooklyn/", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771370504/similar.json"}, "title": "Brooklyn", "critics_consensus": "", "release_dates": {"dvd": "2016-03-15", "theater": "2015-11-04"}, "abridged_cast": [{"name": "Saoirse Ronan", "characters": ["Eilis Lacey"], "id": "770680691"}, {"name": "Domhnall Gleeson", "characters": ["Jim Farrell"], "id": "770702167"}, {"name": "Emory Cohen", "characters": ["Tony"], "id": "770813996"}, {"name": "Eileen O'Higgins", "characters": ["Nancy"], "id": "771073728"}, {"name": "Julie Walters", "characters": ["Mrs. Kehoe"], "id": "162662872"}], "synopsis": "BROOKLYN tells the profoundly moving story of Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish immigrant navigating her way through 1950s Brooklyn.
