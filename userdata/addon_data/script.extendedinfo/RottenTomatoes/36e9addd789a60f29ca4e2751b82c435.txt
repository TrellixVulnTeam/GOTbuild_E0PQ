Her inspired performance on a ruptured Achilles at the world's most prestigious gymnastics tournament clinched an unlikely bronze medal for the U.S. team and brought glory to her hometown of Amherst, Ohio. But in the years since that epic third place victory, Hope hasn't done a whole lot with her life. Still living in her dad Stan's (Gary Cole) basement, still sporting her daily uniform of a Team USA gym suit with teeny-bopper bangs, ponytail and scrunchie, she spends her days at the mall milking her minor celebrity for free food and favors. Hope's routine is upended when she learns that she must coach Amherst's newest gymnastics prodigy Maggie (Haley Lu Richardson) in order to receive a sizeable financial inheritance. The hard-edged yet insecure Hope is faced with a serious dilemma: does she jeopardize her \"hometown hero\" status by devotedly training this rising star to achieve the dreams she never could? Or does she attempt to sabotage the impressionable Maggie to ensure that she remains the one and only star in Amherst?", "mpaa_rating": "R", "year": 2016, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "3859304"}, "posters": {"profile": "http://resizing.flixster.com/ldaDYxGfY09EWzkUshexOEVLGHQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTQ1MjUxNjtqOzE3MDIzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA", "detailed": "http://resizing.flixster.com/ldaDYxGfY09EWzkUshexOEVLGHQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTQ1MjUxNjtqOzE3MDIzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA", "thumbnail": "http://resizing.flixster.com/ldaDYxGfY09EWzkUshexOEVLGHQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTQ1MjUxNjtqOzE3MDIzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA", "original": "http://resizing.flixster.com/ldaDYxGfY09EWzkUshexOEVLGHQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTQ1MjUxNjtqOzE3MDIzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA"}, "runtime": 104, "id": "771409701"}, {"ratings": {"critics_score": 13, "audience_score": 45, "critics_rating": "Rotten", "audience_rating": "Spilled"}, "links": {"reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771371932/reviews.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771371932/cast.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771371932.json", "alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gods_of_egypt/", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771371932/similar.json"}, "title": "Gods Of Egypt", "critics_consensus": "", "release_dates": {"theater": "2016-02-26"}, "abridged_cast": [{"name": "Gerard Butler", "characters": ["Set"], "id": "162659102"}, {"name": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau", "characters": ["Horus"], "id": "559808757"}, {"name": "Brenton Thwaites", "characters": ["Bek"], "id": "771420717"}, {"name": "Geoffrey Rush", "characters": ["Ra"], "id": "162659119"}, {"name": "Chadwick Boseman", "characters": ["Thoth"], "id": "771363198"}], "synopsis": "In this spectacular action-adventure inspired by the classic mythology of Egypt, the survival of mankind hangs in the balance as an unexpected mortal hero Bek [Brenton Thwaites] undertakes a thrilling journey to save the world and rescue his true love.
